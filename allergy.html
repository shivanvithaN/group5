                        An allergy is a reaction by your immune system to something that does not bother most other people. People who have allergies often are sensitive to more than one thing. Substances that often cause reactions are:

Pollen
Dust mites
Mold spores
Pet dander
Food
Insect stings
Medicines
Normally, your immune system fights germs. It is your body's defense system. In most allergic reactions, however, it is responding to a false alarm. Genes and the environment probably both play a role.

Allergies can cause a variety of symptoms such as a runny nose, sneezing, itching, rashes, swelling, or asthma. Allergies can range from minor to severe. Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction that can be life-threatening. Doctors use skin and blood tests to diagnose allergies. Treatments include medicines, allergy shots, and avoiding the substances that cause the reactions.

<b>1. Nasal saline irrigation</b> There is some good evidence that saline nasal irrigation (putting salt water into one nostril and draining it out the other) can be useful for modest improvement of allergy symptoms. Nasal irrigation is generally safe; however, neti pots and other rinsing devices must be used and cleaned properly. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, tap water that is not filtered, treated, or processed in specific ways is not safe for use as a nasal rinse.
<p></p>
<b>2. Butterbur extract</b> There are hints that the herb butterbur may decrease the symptoms associated with nasal allergies. However, there are concerns about its safety.
<p></p>
<b>3. Honey</b> Only a few studies have looked at the effects of honey on seasonal allergy symptoms, and there is no convincing scientific evidence that honey provides symptom relief. Eating honey is generally safe; however, children under 1 year of age should not eat honey. People who are allergic to pollen or bee stings may also be allergic to honey.                    
<p></p>
<b>4. Acupuncture</b> A 2015 evaluation of 13 studies of acupuncture for allergic rhinitis, involving a total of 2,365 participants, found evidence that this approach may be helpful.
<p></p>
<b>5. Probiotics</b> There is some evidence that suggests that probiotics may improve some symptoms, as well as quality of life, in people with allergic rhinitis, but because probiotic formulations vary from study to study, it's difficult to make firm conclusions about its effectiveness.
<p></p>
<b>6. Talk to your health care provider</b> If you suffer from seasonal allergies and are considering a complementary health approach, talk to your health care provider about the best ways to manage your symptoms. You may find that when the pollen count is high, staying indoors, wearing a mask, or rinsing off when you come inside can help.
